 Basic first person movement and interaction prototype in Unity

The main purpose of this prototype was to explore some implementation for basic game in which the player would explore a 3D space and speak to NPCs or interact with objects using the Unity engine. In addition to exprimenting with a visual style as seen in screenshots.

Some features:
- Singleton game manager design
- Basic mouse look and character movement for the player
- Simple user input activated interaction for nearby interactables 
- Multi-line text which prints one character at a time and advances with user prompting
- Text which is imported from an .xml format and then looked up with identification
- Simple NavMesh navigation
- Gray cylinders
